## Description
I am thrilled to introduce my phase 3 web application, designed as a tribute to my beloved wife Shaina, who has a penchant for reading and being organized. This app has been specifically created to keep track of books, movies, and TV shows that we plan to read and watch, as well as the ones we have already enjoyed. At present, the application can only manage books, but we plan to incorporate movies and TV shows in the future. The app showcases a comprehensive list of all the books that we have entered into the system. Clicking on an author's name displays a page that lists all the books written by that author. Moreover, the books page provides a button that allows users to create a new book, which includes fields for the title, series name (if applicable), an author selection from a list, or the option to add a new author, notes, and a checkbox that indicates if the book has been read.
